# GaussianBlueNoise
Windows compilation of Gaussian Blue Noise https://abdallagafar.com/publications/gbn/

To get this to compile on windows, I had to find a windows build of cairo (included), and a windows replacement for "getopt". I also had to make a couple small changes to the code.

See readme.txt for more information about the changes, as well as example command line parameters
